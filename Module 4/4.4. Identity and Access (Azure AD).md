# Identity and Access (Azure AD)

- Old-school corporate security
  - Traditionally relied on network perimeters, firewalls, and physical access controls to secure systems.
  - This approach does not effectively address modern needs such as bring your own device (BYOD) policies, mobile apps, and cloud-based applications.
- Identity = new primary security boundary
  - Proper authentication (verifying who someone is) and the correct assignment of privileges (permissions) are crucial for controlling access to your data.
  - This approach allows you to maintain a security perimeter even when physical control is not possible.
  - It ensures that you always know who has the ability to view and manipulate your data and infrastructure, especially when configured with [single sign-on](#single-sign-on) and proper [role-based access](#role-based-access-control).

## Authentication and Authorization

- Azure provides services to manage both authentication and authorization through [Azure Active Directory](#azure-active-directory).

### Authentication

- üìù This is the process of verifying the identity of a person or service trying to access a resource.
  - It determines whether they are who they claim to be.
- Authentication involves challenging the individual or service for legitimate credentials. This process helps create a security principal, which is a basis for managing identity and access control.
- Sometimes referred to as **AuthN**.

### Authorization

- üìù Authorization determines what level of access an authenticated person or service has.
- It specifies which data they can access and what actions they can perform with it.
- Often abbreviated as **AuthZ**.

## Azure Active Directory

- Also known as **Azure AD**.
- A cloud-based service for managing identities.
- Can sync with existing on-premises Active Directory or function independently.
- Facilitates identity sharing across cloud-based services (like Microsoft 365) and mobile or on-premises applications.
- ‚ùóüìù The free tier does not have a Service Level Agreement (SLA), while the standard and premium tiers offer 99.9% uptime guarantees.
- Key services include:
  - **Authentication**
    - Self-service password reset.
    - [Multi-factor authentication (MFA)](#multi-factor-authentication).
    - Custom banned password lists and smart lockout features.
  - **[Single Sign-On (SSO)](#single-sign-on)**
  - **Application management**: Manage cloud and on-premises applications using tools like Azure AD Application Proxy, SSO, the My apps portal (also known as Access panel), and SaaS applications.
  - **Business to Business (B2B) identity services**: Manage guest users and external partners.
  - **Business to Customer (B2C) identity services**: Customize how users sign up, sign in, and manage their profiles when using applications and services.
  - **Device Management**
    - Manage how devices, whether cloud-based or on-premises, access corporate data.

### Single Sign-On

- Users often have multiple identities, which means multiple passwords, making it difficult to remember them all.
  - This increases the risk of credential-related security incidents.
  - Management becomes more complex with more account lockouts and password reset requests.
    - If a user leaves an organization, all their identities must be tracked and managed.
- Single Sign-On (SSO) simplifies this by using a single identity.
  - One password grants access to all applications.
  - üìù This reduces management effort, especially when a user leaves an organization.
- üìù SSO also allows the use of third-party identities, including on-premises identities, in Azure.

#### SSO with Azure Active Directory

- Azure AD enables the integration of various data sources into an intelligent **security graph**.
  - This graph provides capabilities such as:
    - Threat analysis
    - Real-time identity protection
- This is applied to all accounts in Azure AD, which can be synchronized from on-premises systems.
- A centralized identity provider like Azure AD is advantageous for:
  - Centralizing security controls, reporting, alerting, and administration of identity infrastructure.
- For example, it allows users to sign in to email and Office 365 documents without needing to re-authenticate.

### Multi-Factor Authentication

- Also known as MFA.
- Requires two or more types of elements to complete authentication.
  - **Something you know**
    - For example, a password or the answer to a security question.
  - **Something you possess**
    - For example, a mobile app that receives notifications or a device that generates tokens.
  - **Something you are**
    - For example, a fingerprint or facial scan, often used on mobile devices.
- üí° Enabling MFA wherever possible increases security.

#### Azure AD MFA

- Integrates with third-party MFA providers as well.
- üí° It is strongly recommended to use MFA, particularly for roles with high privileges, such as the Global Administrator role in Azure AD.
- üìù MFA can be conditionally activated using **Azure AD Identity Protection**.
  - For instance, it can be triggered when a user signs in from an unfamiliar computer.

### Providing Identities to Services

- Services benefit from having identities.
- It is a common but insecure practice to embed credential information in configuration files.
  - If these files lack proper security measures, anyone with access to the systems or repositories can potentially expose these credentials.

#### Service Identities in Azure AD

##### Service Principals

- **Identity**: Something that can be authenticated.
  - For example, users with a username and password.
  - Applications or servers with secret keys or certificates.
- **Principal**: An identity performing specific roles or having certain claims.
  - You can have the same identity with different roles, similar to running `sudo` in a Bash prompt or using "run as Administrator" in Windows.
  - Groups are also considered principals as they can have assigned rights.
- **Service Principal**: An identity used by a service or application, which can be assigned roles.

##### Managed Identities

- Azure handles authentication and account management automatically.
- Managed identities can be created instantly for any Azure service that supports them.
- They enable the authenticated service to securely access other Azure resources, similar to how a standard AD account would.

### Roles in Azure

- Azure supports different types of roles.
- Three main categories: [classic roles](#classic-roles), [Azure roles](#role-based-access-control), and [Azure AD roles](#azure-ad-roles).

#### Classic Roles

- üìù Before the introduction of [Role-based Access Control](#role-based-access-control), there were three main roles:
  - **Account Administrator**: ‚ùó Only one per Azure account.
  - **Service Administrator**: ‚ùó Only one per Azure subscription.
  - **Co-Administrator**: ‚ùó Up to 200 per subscription.

### Role-Based Access Control

- Also known as **Azure roles**.
- üìù Provides detailed access management for Azure resources.
- **Role**
  - Defined as a set of permissions.
  - For example, roles could include "Read-only" or "Contributor."
  - Identities are mapped to roles either directly or through group membership.
- **Role Assignments**
  - When assigned to a role, RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) allows specific actions, such as reading, writing, or deleting resources.
  - For example:
    - Allowing one user to manage VMs within a subscription.
    - Allowing an application to access all resources in a resource group.
- Roles can be assigned at different levels of the Azure Resource Manager hierarchy.
  - Roles assigned at a higher scope, such as an entire subscription, are inherited by lower levels, like service instances.
  - ![Role Assignment Scope](./img/role-assignment-scope.png)
- üí° It's important to segregate duties within your team and grant only the necessary access required for specific tasks.
- Four fundamental Azure roles: **Owner**, **Contributor**, **Reader**, **User Access Administrator**.

### Azure AD Roles

- Roles specific to the Azure AD tenant.
- **Global Administrator**: The person who signs up for the Azure AD tenant and has full control.
- Other roles include **User Administrator** and **Billing Administrator**.

#### Privileged Identity Management

- Also known as **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM)**.
- Provides ongoing auditing of role members to keep track of changes as the organization evolves.
- Features include:
  - Oversight of role assignments.
  - Self-service role activation.
  - Just-in-time role activation.
  - Regular access reviews for Azure AD and Azure resources.
