# Shared Responsibility Model

- Cloud security involves both cloud providers and customers sharing the responsibilities to ensure data protection and system security.
- Azure, like other cloud platforms, holds multiple security certifications from external auditors to validate its security practices.
- **Physical Security**
  - Managed entirely by Microsoft.
  - Includes measures such as physical barriers (walls), surveillance systems (cameras), controlled entry points (gates), and security personnel.
  - Enforces strict access procedures and protocols for Microsoft employees to protect physical assets.
- **Digital Security**
  - A combined responsibility of the customer and Microsoft.
  - Azure provides a range of security tools and services to help protect your data, but it is up to the customer to use these tools effectively.
  - Examples of security tools and features include:
    - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Limits access to resources based on user roles.
    - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Adds an extra layer of security beyond just passwords.
    - **Encryption:** Protects data by converting it into a code to prevent unauthorized access.
    - **Monitoring Tools:** Includes detection of login failures, suspicious locations, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
    - **Real-Time Telemetry:** Provides continuous data on system performance and security.
    - **Firewalls:** Control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.
- ❗ You **always** maintain responsibility for:
  - **Data:** Ensuring data is securely stored and handled.
  - **Endpoints:** Securing devices that connect to the cloud.
  - **Accounts:** Managing user accounts and their permissions.
  - **Access Management (Identities):** Controlling who can access your resources and how.

## Cloud Computing Levels

- 📝 The level of responsibility you have varies depending on the cloud service model you choose, ranging from IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) to PaaS (Platform as a Service) to SaaS (Software as a Service).
