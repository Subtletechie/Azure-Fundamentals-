# Microsoft Azure Information Protection (AIP)

- üìù Azure Information Protection (AIP) helps you organize and safeguard your documents and emails. It does this by applying labels that can either classify the content or protect it with encryption.
- Labels can be applied in two main ways:
  - **Automatically**: This happens when rules and conditions set by the administrator determine when and how labels should be applied.
  - **Manually**: Users can apply labels themselves based on their judgment or the guidance provided.
- For example, if a user saves a Microsoft Word document that contains a credit card number, a custom tooltip might appear. This tooltip would suggest labeling the document as `Confidential \ All Employees`, as set up by the administrator.
- Once your content is labeled and classified, AIP allows you to manage and monitor how that content is used. For instance, you can:
  - **Analyze Data Flows**: Understand how information is moving through your organization and gain valuable insights.
  - **Detect Risky Behaviors**: Identify any actions that might be risky and take steps to address them.
  - **Track Document Access**: See who is accessing your documents and how they are being used.
  - **Prevent Data Leakage**: Stop sensitive information from being leaked or misused.
- You can obtain AIP in two main ways:
  - **As a Standalone Solution**: Purchase it separately from other Microsoft products.
  - **Through Microsoft Licensing Suites**: It is also available as part of:
    - **Enterprise Mobility + Security**
    - **Microsoft 365 Enterprise**
