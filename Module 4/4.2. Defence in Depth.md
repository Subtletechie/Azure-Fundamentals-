# Defence in Depth

- **Definition:** A strategy designed to slow down or prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. The goal is to delay or stop an attacker by using multiple layers of security. Each layer acts as a barrier, so if one layer is compromised, other layers continue to protect the information.

- **Layered Approach:** This method uses several levels of security. If an attacker gets through one layer, the next layer provides additional protection, minimizing the risk of a security breach.

- **Implementation:** Microsoft applies this strategy in both its physical data centers and across its Azure cloud services to enhance security.

## Layers

### Data

- **Importance:** Attackers usually target data because it is valuable. Data can be stored in various locations, including databases, disks within virtual machines (VMs), applications like Microsoft 365, or cloud storage services.

- **Protection:** It's crucial to control who can access and manage data to ensure it is safe. Regulatory requirements often dictate specific controls and processes to maintain data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

### Application

- **Security:** Ensure that applications are designed and maintained with security in mind. Applications should be free of vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

- **Secret Management:** Store sensitive application secrets, like passwords and keys, in secure storage solutions.

- **Design and Development:** Integrate security measures into every stage of application development. This includes planning, building, testing, and deploying applications to ensure they are secure.

### Compute

- **VM Access:** Secure access to virtual machines to prevent unauthorized use.

- **Endpoint Protection:** Install security measures on endpoints, such as antivirus software, and keep all systems up-to-date with the latest patches to defend against malware and other threats.

### Networking

- **Communication Control:** Restrict the communication between different resources to limit potential attack vectors.

- **Default Deny:** Implement a "deny by default" policy, allowing only the necessary communications and blocking everything else.

- **Internet Access:** Limit inbound and outbound internet access to minimize exposure. Ensure secure connections to on-premises networks.

### Perimeter

- **DDoS Protection:** Use Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection to filter and block large-scale attacks before they can disrupt service.

- **Firewalls:** Deploy perimeter firewalls to monitor and alert on potential malicious activity targeting your network.

### Identity and Access

- **Access Control:** Manage who has access to your infrastructure and control changes to it. Grant access based on necessity.

- **Authentication:** Use single sign-on (SSO) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance security.

- **Auditing:** Regularly audit access and changes to ensure that all activities are tracked and any anomalies are detected.

### Physical Security

- **Building Security:** Ensure that physical access to your data centers and computing hardware is controlled and monitored.

- **First Line of Defense:** Physical security measures are the initial protection layer against unauthorized access and threats.
