# Network Protection

- Securing your network is crucial to protect it from attacks and unauthorized access.
- Adopt a layered security approach:
  - It's not sufficient to only secure the network perimeter or the internal network communication between services.
  - A layered approach reduces the risk of exposure to network-based attacks.
  - This involves securing your internet-facing resources, internal resources, and the communication between on-premises networks.
  - Use a combination of Azure networking and security services:
    - For example, use Azure Firewall to safeguard both inbound and outbound traffic to the Internet, and Network Security Groups to control traffic within your virtual networks.

## Internet Protection

- Focus on protecting the perimeter of your network.
- This involves limiting and eliminating attacks originating from the internet.
- Allow only necessary inbound and outbound communication:
  - Ensure that communications are restricted to the required ports and protocols.
    - You can use [Azure Security Center](./4.3.%20Azure%20Security%20Center.md) to manage this.

### Firewall

- A firewall is a service that controls access based on the originating IP address of each request.
- It provides protection for inbound traffic at the network perimeter.
- You create firewall rules:
  - A firewall rule specifies ranges of IP addresses that are allowed to access the server.
  - These rules often include details about the network protocol and port information.

#### Azure Firewall

- Azure Firewall is a managed, highly available, and scalable firewall service at the network level.
- Provides inbound protection for non-HTTP/S protocols:
  - Examples include Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Secure Shell (SSH), and File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
- Provides outbound protection for all ports and protocols:
  - Also offers application-level protection for outbound HTTP/S traffic.

#### Azure Application Gateway

- Azure Application Gateway is a load balancer with an integrated **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**:
  - The WAF protects against common vulnerabilities in web applications.
- It is designed specifically to protect HTTP traffic.

#### Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs)

- NVAs are suitable for non-HTTP services or complex configurations:
  - They are similar to traditional hardware firewall appliances.

### Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Protection

- Any resource exposed on the internet can be vulnerable to DDoS attacks.
- üìù DDoS attacks attempt to overwhelm a network resource:
  - They flood the resource with so many requests that it becomes slow or unresponsive.
- üí° Combine [Azure DDoS Protection](#azure-ddos-protection) with best practices in application design to enhance protection.

#### Azure DDoS Protection

- Provides DDoS mitigation capabilities in every Azure region.
- üìù Protects your Azure applications by monitoring traffic at the Azure network edge before it affects your service's availability.
- üìù Azure Monitor metrics alert you within minutes if an attack is detected.

##### Service Tiers

###### Basic

- Automatically enabled as part of the Azure platform.
- Provides continuous traffic monitoring and real-time mitigation of common network-level DDoS attacks.
- Used by Microsoft's own online services.

###### Standard

- Customized specifically for Microsoft Azure Virtual Network resources.
- Does not require changes to your application.
- Uses dedicated traffic monitoring and machine learning algorithms.
- Applies policies to public IP addresses associated with resources deployed in virtual networks:
  - Examples include Azure Load Balancer and Application Gateway.
- Mitigates various types of attacks:
  - **Volumetric attacks**: Aim to overwhelm the network layer with a large amount of seemingly legitimate traffic.
  - **Protocol attacks**: Exploit weaknesses in layer 3 and layer 4 protocols to make a target inaccessible.
  - **Resource (application) layer attacks**: Disrupt the data transmission between hosts by targeting web application packets.

## Traffic Inside Your Virtual Network

- Allows you to control and limit communication between resources based on necessity.

### Virtual Network Security

#### Network Security Groups (NSGs)

- üìù NSGs define a set of allowed and denied communications for network interfaces and subnets:
  - Used for managing communication between virtual machines.
- Filters network traffic to and from Azure resources in a virtual network:
  - By source and destination IP address, port, and protocol.
- Can include multiple inbound and outbound security rules.

#### Service Endpoints

- Restrict access to services through service endpoints:
  - This removes public internet access to your services.
- Access is limited to within your virtual network.

### Network Integration

- Connect on-premises networks with services in Azure through various methods: VPN or ExpressRoute.

#### Virtual Private Network (VPN)

- Establishes secure communication channels between networks.
- Connects Azure Virtual Network to an on-premises VPN device.
- Ensures secure communication between the networks.

#### Azure ExpressRoute

- Provides a private, dedicated connection between your network and Azure.
- Extends your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection with a connectivity provider.
- Very secure because it transmits traffic over a private circuit rather than the public internet:
  - You can route this traffic through additional appliances for further inspection.
