# Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)

- **Set of Guidance, Best Practices, Tools, and Processes**
  - This set is used internally at Microsoft to create more secure products and services.
- **Purpose**
  - It introduces security and privacy considerations at every stage of the development process.
  - Helps developers:
    - Build software that is highly secure.
    - Address requirements for security compliance.
    - Reduce costs associated with development.

## Provide Training

- **Everyone's Responsibility**
  - Security is not just for security experts; it involves:
    - Developers
    - Service engineers
    - Program and project managers
- **What Everyone Must Understand**
  - Basic security concepts
  - How to incorporate security into software and services
  - The perspective of attackers, including their goals and possible attack methods

## Define Security Requirements

- **Continuous Updates**
  - Security requirements should be updated regularly to reflect changes in functionality and the threat landscape.
- **Best Timing**
  - Define security requirements early during design and planning stages to integrate security smoothly and minimize disruptions.
- **Factors Influencing Security Requirements**
  - Legal and industry regulations
  - Internal standards and coding practices
  - Previous incidents
  - Known threats
- **Tracking Requirements**
  - Use tools such as:
    - Work-tracking systems
    - Telemetry from the engineering pipeline

## Define Metrics and Compliance Reporting

- **Setting Standards**
  - Establish minimum acceptable security quality levels and hold teams accountable.
- **Early Definition**
  - Define these standards as early as possible to ensure they are applied throughout the project.
- **Examples**
  - All vulnerabilities rated as "critical" or "important" must be fixed within a specified timeframe.
- **Tracking and Reporting**
  - Track security work to:
    - Establish key performance indicators (KPIs)
    - Ensure security tasks are completed
    - Use bug/work tracking mechanisms to label security defects and work items clearly with their severity

## Perform Threat Modeling

- **Application**
  - Use threat modeling in environments with significant security risks.
- **Benefits**
  - Helps teams:
    1. Identify vulnerabilities effectively and cost-efficiently.
    2. Assess risks associated with threats.
    3. Choose appropriate security features and mitigations.
- **Levels of Application**
  - Threat modeling can be applied to components, applications, or systems.

## Establish Design Requirements

- **Assurance Activities**
  - These activities help engineers to implement secure features, such as using cryptography, authentication, and logging.
- **Design Complexity**
  - Complex designs and security features can introduce vulnerabilities.
- **Consistency**
  - Apply these practices consistently and understand the protections they offer.

## Define and Use Cryptography Standards

- **Encrypt in Transit**
  - Use encryption to protect data from alteration and unintended disclosure during transmission.
- **Importance of Correct Choices**
  - Incorrect choices in cryptography can lead to significant issues.
  - Develop clear encryption standards and specify each element of encryption implementation.
- **Use Vetted Libraries**
  - Employ only industry-vetted encryption libraries and rely on experts for encryption.

## Manage Security Risks from Using Third-Party Components

- **Understand Risks**
  - Assess the impact of vulnerabilities in third-party components on the overall system.
- **Response Planning**
  - Plan how to respond to newly discovered vulnerabilities and consider additional validation.

## Use Approved Tools

- **Tool Lists**
  - Define and publish a list of approved tools and their associated security checks.
- **Update Tools**
  - Use the latest versions of approved tools and take advantage of new security features and protections.

## Perform Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST)

- **Source Code Analysis**
  - Analyzing source code before compilation offers a scalable method to review security.
  - Ensures that secure coding policies are being followed.
- **Integration**
  - Typically integrated into the commit pipeline to identify vulnerabilities each time software is built or packaged.
- **Functionality**
  - Some tools replace unsafe or banned functions while coding.
