# Encryption (Azure Key Vault, Certificates)

- **Encryption** is the process of transforming data into a format that is unreadable and unusable to anyone who does not have the correct authorization. This is done to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access. 
- To access or read the encrypted data, it must be converted back into its original format using a decryption key. 
- Encryption serves as a crucial layer in a security strategy, acting as the last and strongest defense against data breaches.

## Encryption Types

### Symmetric Encryption

- **Symmetric encryption** involves using the same key for both encrypting and decrypting data.
- For example, a desktop password manager application like [Password Orbit](https://erkinekici.com/projects/password-orbit) uses a key derived from your master password and key file to encrypt your passwords. This same key is then used when you need to retrieve your passwords.

### Asymmetric Encryption

- **Asymmetric encryption** uses a pair of keys: a public key and a private key.
  - One key is used to encrypt the data, while the other key (the paired key) is required to decrypt it. Neither key can decrypt data encrypted by itself.
  - This method is used in scenarios like Transport Layer Security (TLS), which is employed in HTTPS to secure communications over the internet, and for digital signatures.

## Encryption Ways

### Encryption at Rest

- **Encryption at rest** refers to the encryption of data that is stored on a physical medium.
  - Data at rest includes information stored on devices like server disks, databases, or storage accounts.
- This form of encryption ensures that stored data remains unreadable without the decryption key. 
- For instance, if an attacker obtains a hard drive with encrypted data but does not have the decryption keys, accessing or compromising the data would be extremely difficult.
- üí° Good practice examples for encryption at rest include:
  - Critical financial information
  - Intellectual property
  - Personal customer data
  - Employee data
  - Encryption keys and secrets used for protecting the data itself.

### Encryption in Transit

- **Encryption in transit** protects data as it is actively moving from one location to another, such as over the internet or through a private network.
- This type of encryption ensures that the data is secure from external observers while it is being transmitted.
  - Only the intended recipient, who possesses the secret key, can decrypt and use the data.
- Secure data transfer can be managed at different layers:
  - At the application layer, such as with HTTPS.
  - At the network layer, using secure channels like Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).

## Encryption on Azure

- For raw storage, refer to [Azure Storage Service Encryption](#azure-storage-service-encryption).
- For virtual machine disks, refer to [Azure Disk Encryption](#azure-disk-encryption).
- For databases, refer to [Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)](#transparent-data-encryption-tde).
- For managing secrets, refer to [Azure Key Vault](#azure-key-vault).

### Azure Storage Service Encryption

- **Azure Storage Service Encryption** enables the encryption of raw storage data.
- This service automatically encrypts your data before it is saved to Azure Managed Disks, Azure Blob storage, Azure Files, or Azure Queue storage.
  - It also decrypts the data when it is retrieved.
- The process of encryption, decryption, and key management is handled transparently, meaning that applications interact with the data without needing to handle encryption directly.

### Azure Disk Encryption

- **Azure Disk Encryption** helps protect your Windows and Linux virtual machine disks.
- It uses BitLocker for Windows and dm-crypt for Linux to provide encryption for both the OS and data disks.
- Integrated with Azure Key Vault, it allows you to control and manage the encryption keys and secrets.
  - You can also use [managed service identities](./4.4.%20Identity%20and%20Access%20(Azure%20AD).md#managed-identities) to access Key Vault.

### Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)

- **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)** provides encryption for:
  - Azure SQL Database: This feature is enabled by default.
  - Azure Synapse Analytics
- TDE performs real-time encryption and decryption of:
  - The database itself
  - Associated backups
  - Transaction log files
- It uses a symmetric key known as the database encryption key.
  - Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) is supported, allowing you to store your keys in [Azure Key Vault](#azure-key-vault).

### Azure Key Vault

- üìù **Azure Key Vault** manages:
  - **Secrets**: Includes items like passwords, certificates, API keys, and other sensitive information.
  - **Keys**: Used to create and control the encryption keys that protect your data.
  - **Certificates**: Helps with the provisioning, management, and deployment of public and private [SSL / TLS](#transport-layer-security-tls) certificates.
    - You can create policies to manage the lifecycle of certificates.
    - Provides contact information for notifications about certificate expiration and renewal.
    - Allows automatic renewal of certificates with selected issuers.
    - For more details, see [Azure certificates](#azure-certificates).
- Keys and secrets can be protected by software or hardware security modules (HSMs).
- Provides secure access, permission control (RBAC), and access logging.
- Simplifies administration, making it easier to enroll or renew certificates.
- Integrates with other Azure services like storage accounts, container registries, and event hubs.
  - Applications with [managed service identities](./4.4.%20Identity%20and%20Access%20(Azure%20AD).md#managed-identities) can seamlessly acquire the secrets they need.

#### Azure Certificates

##### Transport Layer Security (TLS)

- **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** forms the basis for encrypting website data as it travels over the internet.
- It uses certificates to encrypt and decrypt data, which require careful management.
  - Certificates have a lifecycle and require administrative oversight.
  - Expired TLS certificates can pose security risks.
- Certificates used in Azure are typically x.509 v3 certificates, which can be:
  - Signed by a trusted certificate authority.
  - Self-signed, which are not trusted by default but can be used for development and testing.
- Certificates can contain either a private or public key, each with a unique thumbprint.
  - This thumbprint is used in Azure configuration files to identify which certificate a cloud service should use.

##### Types of Certificates

###### Service Certificates

- **Service certificates** are linked to specific cloud services.
  - They enable secure communication to and from the service.
  - For example, if you deploy a website, you would use a certificate to authenticate an HTTPS endpoint.
  - Defined in your service definition, these certificates are automatically deployed to the virtual machine running your service instance.
- Service certificates can be managed separately from the services they support.
  - You can upload service certificates to Azure and manage them independently.
  - For example, a developer might upload a service package referencing a certificate uploaded by an IT manager.
    - The IT manager can manage and renew the certificate without needing to upload a new service package.
- Updating a certificate does not require re-deploying the entire service package.
  - Simply upload a new certificate and update the thumbprint in the service configuration file.

###### Management Certificates

- **Management certificates** are used to authenticate with the classic deployment model.
- They enable automation for configuring and deploying certain Microsoft and Azure services.
  - For example, tools like Visual Studio or the Azure SDK use these certificates.
- These certificates are not related to cloud services directly.
