- **You can use Security Center during the [detect](#detect), [assess](#assess), and [diagnose](#diagnose) stages.**

##### Detect

- **Review the initial indication of an event investigation**
  - For example, use the Security Center dashboard to check if a high-priority security alert has been raised.

##### Assess

- **Perform the initial assessment to gather more information about the suspicious activity**
  - For instance, obtain details about the security alert to understand its nature.

##### Diagnose

- **Conduct a technical investigation to identify containment, mitigation, and workaround strategies**
  - For example, follow the remediation steps suggested by Security Center for the specific security alert.

### Recommendations to Enhance Security

#### Security Policy

- **Set of controls recommended for resources within a specified subscription or resource group**
  - By configuring a security policy, you can reduce the likelihood of significant security incidents.

#### Recommendations

- **Based on security policies for potential vulnerabilities**
  - Guides you through configuring the necessary security controls.
  - For example, if certain workloads do not need the Azure SQL Database Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) policy, disable it at the subscription level and enable it only in resource groups where SQL TDE is required.
