# Cost Optimization Best Practices

## Save on infrastructure

### Use Azure credits

- You receive $50 per month for Visual Studio Professional and $150 per month for Visual Studio Enterprise.
- This provides you with a separate Azure subscription that renews each month as long as you remain an active Visual Studio subscriber.
- ‚ùó Note that there is no Service Level Agreement (SLA) for these credits; they are intended for development and testing only.
  - Azure will suspend Virtual Machines (VMs) used for production or those that run more than 120 hours.

### Use spending limits

- ‚ùó Spending limits are not available for pay-only subscriptions; they apply only to subscriptions with monthly Azure credits.
- This feature helps prevent you from exhausting the credit on your account within each billing period.
  - The limit resets at the end of each billing period.
- Spending limits are activated by default, but you can adjust the spending limit as needed or turn it off entirely.

### Use reserved instances

- Purchase Windows/Linux VMs for one-year or three-year terms, with options to pay for the entire period upfront or monthly.
- This approach can save you up to 70 to 80 percent compared to pay-as-you-go pricing.
- üí° Reserved instances are ideal for virtual machines with static and predictable usage patterns.

### Choose low-cost locations and regions

- Azure pricing varies by location and region.
- üí° It is cost-effective to select locations and regions where the services are cheaper.
- ‚ùó Be aware that transferring data between different locations can incur additional costs, potentially making the overall expense higher.
  - Keeping resources in the same region helps reduce egress (outgoing network bandwidth) traffic and associated costs.

### Research available cost-saving offers

- Stay informed about the latest offers and switch to those that provide the most benefits.
- Check [Azure Updates](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/) for the latest updates, roadmaps, and announcements.

### Right-size underutilized virtual machines

- Over-sized virtual machines often result in unnecessary expenses on Azure.
- [Azure Cost Management](./6.3.%20Azure%20Costs%20&%20Tools.md#azure-cost-management) and [Azure Advisor](./6.3.%20Azure%20Costs%20&%20Tools.md#azure-advisor) can recommend right-sizing or shutting down VMs.
- Right-sizing involves resizing a VM to a more appropriate size.
  - For example, downgrading a `Standard_D4sv3` VM with 90% idle time to a `Standard_D2sv3` VM can reduce costs by 50%.
- ‚ùó Resizing a VM requires stopping it, resizing it, and then restarting it.
  - üí° This process takes a few minutes, so plan for a short outage or redirect traffic to another instance during this time.

### Deallocate virtual machines in off hours

- VMs do not need to run continuously if they are only used during specific times.
- Shut down VMs when they are not in use and start them on a schedule.
  - This saves money on compute costs, üìù but you will still incur charges for storage.
- You can use [automation accounts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-solution-vm-management) or the **auto-shutdown** feature on a virtual machine to automate shutdowns.

### Delete unused virtual machines

- Removing unused VMs can reduce both infrastructure costs and potentially lower licensing and operational expenses.

### Migrate to PaaS or SaaS services

- Evaluate if transitioning to Platform as a Service (PaaS) is beneficial for your architecture.
  - Azure efficiently operates hardware and offers PaaS services at a lower cost.
- A typical evolution involves moving from Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to PaaS gradually as you migrate to the cloud.
- PaaS can reduce both resource and operational costs.
- The effort required varies:
  - Moving from SQL Server to Azure SQL Database is relatively straightforward.
  - Transitioning a multi-tier application to a container or serverless architecture can be more challenging and may not provide immediate cost savings.
    - Consider the long-term benefits and potential cost savings.
- Visit [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/) for ideas on transforming your application and best practices.

## Save on licensing costs

### Linux vs. Windows

- The cost of running a virtual machine can differ based on the operating system you choose.
- Comparing pricing can help you determine if switching operating systems can result in cost savings.

### Azure Hybrid Benefit

- This benefit allows you to use existing:
  - On-premises Windows Server licenses for Azure VMs (***Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server***).
  - SQL Server licenses for Azure SQL Databases (***Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server***).
- This means you only pay the Linux rates for these virtual machines.
- ‚ùó This benefit is available only through Software Assurance licenses.

### Use Dev/Test subscription offers

- For Enterprise Agreement subscribers: [Enterprise Dev/Test](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0148p/)
  - For Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) subscribers: [Dev/Test](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0023p/)
- Discounts include:
  - No license charges for Windows workloads; billing is at the Linux rate.
  - SQL Server and other software under Visual Studio subscriptions (formerly known as MSDN) are included.
- ‚ùó Users (excluding testers) must have a Visual Studio subscription.
- ‚ùó This offer is only available for non-production workloads.

### Bring your own SQL Server license

- ‚ùó Available for customers with an Enterprise Agreement.
- You can use unused on-premises licenses on Azure.
- Search for `BYOL SQL` in the Azure marketplace.

### Use SQL Server Developer Edition

- SQL Server Developer Edition is available for free for non-production use.
- It includes all features of the Enterprise Edition.
- You can find SQL Server Developer Edition images on the Azure Marketplace for development and testing purposes.

### Use constrained instance sizes for database workloads

- Many database workloads have high memory, storage, or I/O bandwidth requirements but lower CPU core count needs.
  - Opt for VM sizes with fewer vCPUs.
- Databases like SQL Server and Oracle are licensed per CPU.
  - This approach can reduce licensing costs by up to 75 percent.
