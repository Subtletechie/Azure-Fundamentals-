# Capital Expenditure (CapEx) vs Operational Expenditure (OpEx)

- Before: Capital Expenditure (CapEx) involves significant upfront costs for hardware and infrastructure needed to start or expand a business.
  - With cloud computing: Operational Expenditure (OpEx) allows you to use services without needing substantial upfront costs or setup time.
- üìù Hybrid solution = Combines both CapEx (on-premises) and OpEx (cloud) models.
- CapEx can also be applied in the cloud, for instance, with [Azure Reserved VM Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/reserved-vm-instances/).
- The CapEx model can still be used in cloud environments.

## Capital Expenditure (CapEx)

- CapEx involves spending money on physical infrastructure initially.
  - This expenditure is then amortized over time, which means it is deducted from your tax bill over multiple years.
- It is an initial cost with a value that depreciates over time.

### Costs of CapEx

- Includes expenses for server hardware, storage systems, network infrastructure, backup and archive solutions, organization continuity and disaster recovery setups, data center infrastructure, and technical personnel.

### Benefits of CapEx

- Provides a clear plan for expenses at the beginning of a project or budget period.
- Costs are fixed, so you know exactly how much you are spending.
- üí° Especially useful when predicting expenses before a project begins, especially if you have a constrained budget.

## Operational Expenditure (OpEx)

- OpEx involves paying for services or products as you use them, with no substantial upfront costs.
  - You are billed for what you use on an ongoing basis.
- Expenses are deducted from your tax bill within the same year.

### Billing of OpEx

- Billing starts as soon as the service provider allocates resources.
  - It is your responsibility to de-provision resources when they are not in use to control costs.
- Cloud computing bills can vary based on:
  - Number of users, CPU usage time, allocated RAM, I/O operations per second (IOPS), and storage space.
- Billing can be done at the user level or organizational level.
- **Pay-per-use** (or subscription model)
  - This model is suitable for both organizations and individual users.
  - You are billed for the services you use, typically on a recurring basis.
  - Example: When using a cloud service, you might pay based on server usage and hardware.

### Costs of OpEx

- Involves leasing software and customizing features as needed.
- Scaling costs depend on actual usage and demand rather than fixed capacity or hardware.
- üí° Consider additional costs for backup and disaster recovery traffic to estimate necessary bandwidth.

### Benefits of OpEx

- CapEx challenge: Demand and growth can be unpredictable and exceed initial forecasts.
  - ![CapEx demand & growth](./img/capex-demand-and-growth.png)
- Companies can try new products or services without investing in physical equipment.
  - You only pay for the infrastructure you actually need, whether it‚Äôs more or less.
- OpEx is especially beneficial if demand is variable or uncertain.
- Enables **cloud agility**
  - Allows you to quickly adjust IT infrastructure to meet changing business needs.
  - Manage costs flexibly and optimize spending based on actual requirements.
  - Example: Higher service usage one month means higher costs, while decreased demand the next month results in lower costs.
