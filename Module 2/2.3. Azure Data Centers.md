# Azure Data Centers

- Azure operates over 100 secure and redundant data centers around the globe, all interconnected through a robust network.
  - This setup allows you to:
    - Expand your global reach while maintaining a local presence.
    - Ensure your data remains secure and complies with local regulations.
- ![Azure data centers](./img/azure-data-centers.png)
- When setting up resources, you can choose the region and sometimes the availability zone where your resources will be deployed.
  - ‚ùóHowever, you cannot select a specific data center or a particular location within a data center.

## Regions

- **Regions**: These are geographical areas that include one or more data centers situated close to each other and connected through a high-speed, low-latency network.
  - Azure manages and distributes resources within each region to balance workloads effectively.
  - Examples include West US, Canada Central, West Europe, Australia East, and Japan West.
- ‚ùóNote that some services or features, such as certain virtual machine sizes or storage types, might only be available in specific regions.
- As of February 2020, Azure regions include:
  - ![Azure regions as of February 2020](./img/azure-regions.png)
- üí° Regions enhance scalability, provide redundancy, and ensure data residency according to local requirements.

### Special Regions

- **Special regions** are designated for specific compliance or legal requirements.
- **Azure Government**:
  - Includes regions such as ***US DoD Central***, ***US Gov Virginia***, and ***US Gov Iowa***.
  - üìù These are isolated instances of Azure dedicated to U.S. government agencies and their partners.
- **China Regions**:
  - Includes ***China East***, ***China North***, and others.
  - These regions are operated through a unique partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet.
  - Microsoft does not directly manage the data centers in these regions.

## Geographies

- **Geographies**: Each region is part of a larger geographic area defined by political or country borders.
  - Each geography adheres to specific service availability, compliance standards, and data residency requirements.
  - Designed to withstand failures in individual regions through dedicated networking infrastructure.
  - üìù **Fault-tolerance**: This refers to an application's ability to detect and correct issues within its environment.
- **Data residency**:
  - Refers to legal or regulatory requirements related to where data is stored.
  - It depends on the country or region where the data is physically located.
  - üí° Consider this carefully when planning your data storage solutions.
- Geographies are divided into:
  - Americas
  - Europe
  - Asia Pacific
  - Middle East and Africa

## Availability Zones

- üìù **Availability Zones**: These are physically separate data centers within an Azure region.
- üí° They offer high availability for applications by providing redundancy.
  - You can replicate compute, storage, networking, and data resources across multiple zones.
  - Note that using Availability Zones may incur higher costs.
  - They are mainly used for virtual machines, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL databases.
  - **Zonal services**: Resources can be pinned to a specific zone.
  - **Zone-redundant services**: These are automatically replicated across zones.
- Each zone has its own independent power, cooling, and network systems.
- Designed to be an ***isolation boundary***:
  - If one zone experiences issues, the other zones continue to operate.
- Zones are labeled as 1, 2, 3:
  - These labels correspond to specific physical zones for each subscription but may differ between subscriptions.
- Connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks.
- ‚ùóSome regions do not support multiple Availability Zones.

## Region Pairs

- Each Azure region is paired with another region within the same geography.
  - For example, West US is paired with East US, and South East Asia is paired with East Asia.
- These pairs are located at least 300 miles (approximately 500 kilometers) apart.
- This setup facilitates the replication of resources, such as virtual machine storage.
  - Some services automatically use geo-redundant storage across paired regions.
- Reduces the risk of service interruptions due to events like natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or network failures.
- If one region fails, services can automatically switch to the paired region.
- Data remains within the same geography as its paired region for compliance and legal reasons (except for Brazil South).
- In the event of a major Azure outage:
  - One region from each pair is prioritized for restoration to ensure that at least one region recovers as quickly as possible.
- Planned updates to Azure services are rolled out to paired regions one at a time to minimize downtime and application disruptions.
