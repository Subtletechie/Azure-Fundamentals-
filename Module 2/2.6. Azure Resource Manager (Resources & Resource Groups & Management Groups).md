# Azure Resource Manager (Resources & Resource Groups & Management Groups)

## Azure Resource

- **Definition**: An Azure resource is any item you create within an Azure subscription. This can include various elements like virtual machines, Application Gateways, and CosmosDB instances.
- **Example**: A virtual machine (VM), an Application Gateway, or a CosmosDB instance.
- **Tip**: Use a consistent naming convention to make management easier. For instance, `cloudarchitecture-prod-infrastructure-rg` could be broken down as follows:
  - **Usage**: Indicates the purpose (`cloudarchitecture`)
  - **Environment**: Specifies the environment (`prod` for production)
  - **Type of Resources**: Details the kind of resources (`infrastructure`)
  - **Resource Type**: Shows the type of resource itself (`rg` stands for resource group)
- **Access Management**: Azure resources utilize [role-based access control (RBAC)](./4.4.%20Identity%20and%20Access%20(Azure%20AD).md#role-based-access-control) to manage permissions precisely.
- **Resource Movement**: Some resources can be moved between resource groups or subscriptions, provided they [support the move operation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-move-resources).

### Tagging

- **Purpose**: Tags help in searching, filtering, and organizing resources and resource groups more effectively.
- **Definition**: Tags are name/value pairs of text that you assign to resources and resource groups. Examples include:
  - **Department**: Tags like `finance`, `marketing`
  - **Environment**: Tags such as `prod`, `test`, `dev`
  - **Cost Center**: Tags to manage expenses
  - **Life Cycle**: Tags for automation tasks like starting and stopping VMs
- **Tip**: Tags can be used to group billing data. For example, you might have a tag for VMs in production associated with a specific cost center.
- **Monitoring**: Tags can help with monitoring. For instance, you could set up alerts based on tags so that if a resource fails, a notification is sent to the finance department.
- **Automation**: Tags can be used for automation. For example, a tag like `shutdown:6PM` and `startup:7AM` can automate the shutting down and starting up of VMs in development environments to save costs.
- **Governance**: Tags can be used to enforce policies through [Azure Policies](./5.1.%20Azure%20Policy%20&%20Azure%20Blueprints.md). For instance, you can enforce a policy that requires all resources to have a `Department` tag, blocking creation if it is missing.
- **Limitations**:
  - A resource can have up to 50 tags.
  - Tags are not inherited from parent resources.
  - Not all resource types support tagging.

### Resource Locks

- **Definition**: Resource locks prevent modification (Read-only) or deletion (Delete) of resources.
  - For more detailed control over what can be deployed, refer to [Azure policies](./5.1.%20Azure%20Policy%20&%20Azure%20Blueprints.md#azure-policy).
- **Read-only Lock**: This lock allows only `HTTP GET` requests, which can lead to issues if other types of requests are needed. For example, listing all objects in a storage account requires a `POST` request, which would be denied under a read-only lock.
- **Lock Removal**: You must remove the lock to perform actions that are otherwise prohibited.
- **Permissions**: Resource locks apply regardless of RBAC permissions.
- **Protection**: They help prevent accidental deletion of critical resources.
- **Tip**: Use locks to safeguard essential resources such as ExpressRoute circuits, virtual networks, critical databases, and domain controllers.
- **Permissions for Lock Management**: Only users with "Owner" or "User Access Administrator" roles can create or delete locks. This requires access to `Microsoft.Authorization/locks/*`.

## Azure Resource Group

- **Definition**: A resource group is a logical container for Azure resources. It can include locks, tags, and RBAC permissions.
  - **Cost**: Resource groups themselves do not incur additional costs.
- **Purpose**: It organizes resources deployed on Azure. A resource group is tied to a specific region and subscription but can contain resources from multiple regions.
  - **Note**: If the region where the resource group resides experiences an outage, the management of the resource group may be affected.
- **Resource Management**: Helps to group resources based on their usage, type, or location.
- **Deletion**: If a resource group is deleted, all resources within it are also deleted.
- **Authorization**: Resource groups are the scope for applying RBAC permissions, which are inherited by all resources within the group.
- **Restrictions**:
  - All resources must belong to a resource group, and a resource can be part of only one resource group.
  - Some services have specific limitations or requirements for moving resources between groups.
  - Resource groups cannot be nested.
- **History**: You can view the history of deployments within a resource group.

### Organizing Resource Groups

- **By Type**: Group resources by their type, such as virtual networks, virtual machines, or Cosmos DBs.
  - ![by type](./img/organize-resource-groups/by-resource-type.png)
- **By Environment**: Organize resources based on the environment like production (prod), quality assurance (qa), or development (dev).
  - ![by environment](./img/organize-resource-groups/by-environment.png)
- **By Department**: Arrange resources according to departments such as marketing, finance, or human resources.
  - ![by department](./img/organize-resource-groups/by-department.png)
- **Combined Strategies**: Use combinations of strategies like environment and department to organize resources.
  - ![by department and environment](./img/organize-resource-groups/by-department-and-environment.png)
- **By Authorization**: Group resources based on who needs to manage them, as outlined in [RBAC](./4.4.%20Identity%20and%20Access%20(Azure%20AD).md#role-based-access-control). For example, you might have a database administration group for database administrators.
- **By Life Cycle**: Organize resources in a way that supports their lifecycle, such as deleting resources after experimentation.
- **By Billing**: Organize resources to better track and understand where costs are incurred.

## Management Groups

- **Definition**: Management groups help organize and manage multiple Azure subscriptions.
- **Permissions and Policies**: They allow for RBAC assignments and policy management that are inherited by the underlying subscriptions.
- **Enterprise Use**: Management groups are especially useful for large organizations and enterprises.
- **Example**:
