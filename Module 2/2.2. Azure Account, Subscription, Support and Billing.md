# Account, Subscription, Support, and Billing

- **Requirements:** A phone number, credit card for identity verification, and a Microsoft/GitHub account.

## Subscription

- **Purpose:** Subscriptions are essential for creating and using Azure services.
- **Creation:** A subscription is automatically created when you sign up for Azure.
- üìù **Definition:** A subscription acts as a logical container that helps you manage and provision resources in Azure. This includes various resources such as virtual machines (VMs), databases, and more.
- üìù **Resource Management:** When you create an Azure resource (like a VM), you specify which subscription it belongs to. The resource usage is tracked and billed monthly.
- üìù **Uniqueness:** Each subscription operates independently and cannot be merged with another.

### Multiple Azure Subscriptions

- **Usage:** You can set up multiple subscriptions to achieve different goals, such as:
  - **Environments:**
    - Examples include separating environments for testing, security, or data isolation to meet compliance requirements.
    - üí° **Benefit:** Resource access control is managed at the subscription level, making it easier to enforce policies.
  - **Organizational Structures:**
    - For instance, you might restrict a team to lower-cost resources while granting the IT department access to a broader range of resources.
    - üí° **Benefit:** Helps manage and control access to resources provisioned within each subscription.
  - **Billing:**
    - Costs are initially aggregated at the subscription level, which helps in managing and tracking expenses based on different needs (e.g., production, development, testing).
- **Subscription Limits:**
  - Each subscription has certain limitations. For example, the maximum number of Express Route circuits per subscription is 10.

## Billing

- **Invoicing:** You will receive a monthly invoice with payment instructions. You can also set up multiple invoices if needed.
- **Customizing Billing:**
  - You can organize charges by department, team, or project while receiving a single invoice for your organization.
  - **Billing Structure:**
    - ![Azure Billing Structure](./img/billing-structure.png)
    - **Billing Account:** Contains one or more billing profiles.
    - **Billing Profile:** Each profile has distinct invoice sections.
