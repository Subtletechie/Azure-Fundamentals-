# Azure Basics

- **Azure** is Microsoft's cloud computing platform, which offers both private and public cloud services.
- It provides developers and IT administrators with tools to:
  - Create, manage, and deploy applications
  - Operate on a vast global network of servers
  - Choose from various tools and frameworks that best fit their needs
- Over 90% of Fortune 500 companies utilize Microsoft Cloud for their operations [[source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/welcome-to-azure/1-introduction)]

## Azure Services

- Azure offers more than 100 different services.
- **Compute Services**: Includes Virtual Machines (VMs) and containers that allow you to run your applications on Azure’s infrastructure.
- **Database Services**: Provides options for both relational databases (which store data in tables) and NoSQL databases (which handle data in various formats).
- **Identity Services**: Helps with user authentication and protecting user identities.
- **Networking Services**: Connects your on-premises data center to Azure’s cloud, ensures high availability, and manages your DNS domain.
- **Storage Solutions**: Can handle large amounts of both structured data (like databases) and unstructured data (like files and documents).
- **AI and Machine Learning Services**: Analyzes data, understands text and images, recognizes speech, and makes predictions based on data.

## How Azure Works

- **Virtualization** is a core technology used in Azure:
  - Uses an abstraction layer called a **hypervisor**.
    - The hypervisor separates the physical hardware (like CPU, RAM, and GPU) from the operating system.
    - It creates **virtual machines** that function like real computers.
      - Multiple virtual machines can run simultaneously on the same hardware.
      - This optimizes the use of hardware resources.
      - Virtual machines can run various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- Azure scales this virtualization technology extensively:
  - Each data center contains many racks filled with servers.
  - Each server runs a hypervisor to manage multiple virtual machines.
  - A network switch connects all these servers.
  - One server in each rack runs special software called a **fabric controller**.
    - Each fabric controller is connected to another software called an **orchestrator**.
      - The orchestrator manages all aspects of Azure, including handling user requests.
        - Users make requests through the **Azure API**.
          - The Azure API can be accessed in various ways, including the Azure Portal.
        - The orchestrator packages the necessary resources and sends them to the fabric controller to fulfill user requests.
