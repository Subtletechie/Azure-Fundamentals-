# Service-level Agreements (SLA)

- SLAs are formal documents that outline the performance expectations for Azure services.
- They also specify the consequences if a service or product does not meet the agreed-upon performance standards.
- SLAs are available for individual Azure products and services.
- ‚ùó Azure does not provide SLAs for most services offered under the Free or Shared tiers.
  - For example, Azure Advisor does not come with an SLA.

- Three key characteristics of SLAs for Azure products and services:
  1. **Performance Targets**
     - These targets are specific to each Azure product and service.
     - For instance, performance targets may include guarantees related to uptime or connectivity rates.
  2. **Uptime and Connectivity Guarantees**
     - üìù Monthly Uptime Percentage is calculated as `(Maximum Available Minutes - Downtime) / Maximum Available Minutes √ó 100`.
     - üìù SLAs typically range from 99.9% ("three nines") to 99.999% ("five nines") for any paid service tier.
       - This means the minimum SLA for all non-free Azure services is 99.9%.
     - For example, [Azure Cosmos DB](./3.2.1.%20Databases.md#azure-cosmos-db) has an SLA of 99.999% uptime.
       - This allows for about 5 minutes of downtime per year.
       - It also promises low-latency commitments, with read and write operations on the database taking less than 10 milliseconds.
  3. üìù **Service Credits**
     - These are offered to paying Azure customers if the service's uptime percentage falls below the SLA guarantee.
     - Service credits describe how Microsoft will address instances where an Azure product or service does not meet its SLA standards.
     - For example, customers might receive a discount on their Azure bill as compensation for a service that is not performing as promised.

## Composite SLA

- Composite SLAs result from combining the SLAs of different services used together.
- üìù Calculating Downtime
  - For example, if a web app with a 99.95% SLA writes to a SQL database with a 99.99% SLA:
    - The composite SLA is calculated as `99.95% √ó 99.99% = 99.94%`
      - This translates to `0.9995 √ó 0.9999 = 0.9994`.
    - This means the combined probability of failure is higher than the individual SLA values suggest.
- You can improve the composite SLA by implementing independent fallback paths.
  - For example, if the SQL Database is unavailable, you could queue transactions for later processing.
    - If a web app with a 99.95% SLA writes to either a SQL Database (99.99%) or a queue (99.9%):
    - The application remains available even if it cannot connect to the database.
      - ‚ùó However, it will fail if both the database and the queue are unavailable simultaneously.
    - If the likelihood of a simultaneous failure is **0.0001 √ó 0.001**:
      - The composite SLA for this setup, with either a database or queue, would be:
        - `1.0 ‚àí (0.0001 √ó 0.001) = 99.99999%`.
    - Including the queue in the web app setup results in:
    - `99.95% √ó 99.99999% = approximately 99.95%`.
    - While this improves the SLA, it also makes application logic more complex.
      - Adding queue support can increase costs and might introduce data-consistency issues due to retry behavior.

## Application SLA

- By defining your own SLAs, you can set performance targets tailored to your specific Azure application.
- üí° For performance targets of four nines (99.99%) or higher:
  - Manual intervention may not be sufficient (it can be too slow).
  - Consider implementing self-diagnosing and self-healing mechanisms.

### Resiliency

- **Resiliency** is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue operating.
- Key components of resiliency include high availability and disaster recovery.
  - üìù **Disaster Recovery**: In the event of a catastrophic event like a natural disaster destroying your data center, alternative locations and procedures should be in place to continue providing the service and to ensure the new location can maintain service delivery.
- **Failure Mode Analysis (FMA)**
  - Goals:
    - Identify potential failure points.
    - Define the application's response to those failures.

### High Availability

- üìù Availability is often expressed as a percentage of uptime.
- It refers to the amount of time a system remains functional and operational.
- Providers strive to maximize the availability of their Azure solutions by minimizing downtime.
  - ‚ùó Increasing availability often leads to higher costs and complexity.
  - As solutions become more complex, they may involve more interdependent services.
    - Overlooking potential failure points becomes more likely with interconnected services.
    - üí° For example, a workload requiring 99.99% uptime should not rely on a service with only a 99.9% SLA.
