# Interacting with Azure

- **[Azure portal](#azure-portal)**: This is the primary way to interact with Azure using a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
- **[Azure PowerShell](#azure-powershell)**, **[Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI)](#azure-cli)**, and **[Azure SDKs](#azure-sdks)**: These tools are used for command-line and automation-based interactions with Azure.
- **[Azure Cloud Shell](#azure-cloud-shell)**: A web-based command-line interface that runs directly in your browser.
- **[Azure mobile app](#azure-mobile-app)**: Allows you to monitor and manage your Azure resources from your mobile device.

## Azure portal

- üìù Access the Azure portal via any web browser at [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
- The portal enables you to create, manage, and monitor all your Azure resources. It offers nearly every function you might need for working with Azure.
- It simplifies complex administrative tasks by using guided wizards and helpful tooltips.
- **Resource panel**
  - Located in the left-hand sidebar, it lists the main types of resources you are using.
  - The resources displayed here are those you have marked as ***favorites***.
  - This panel is customizable; you can modify your default view from ***Home*** by going to Dashboard > Settings.
- **Azure Marketplace**
  - A place where you can provision services from a range of over 8,000 certified providers.
    - Examples include virtual machine images, databases, application build and deployment tools, developer utilities, threat detection services, and blockchain solutions.
- Repetitive tasks in the Azure portal might be candidates for automation using [CLI](#azure-cli) or [PowerShell](#azure-powershell).
