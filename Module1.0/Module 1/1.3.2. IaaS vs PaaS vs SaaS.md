# IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS

## Understanding Cloud Computing Categories

Cloud computing is divided into three main categories: [Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)](#infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas), [Platform as a Service (PaaS)](#platform-as-a-service-paas), and [Software as a Service (SaaS)](#software-as-a-service-saas). These categories can be used individually or in combination, depending on your needs.

For instance, you might use [Microsoft 365 Apps](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/microsoft-365/business/microsoft-365-apps-for-business?market=af) on your company's computers (which is SaaS), while utilizing virtual machines (VMs) from Azure (IaaS) and Azure SQL Database (PaaS) for data storage.

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

- **Definition**: IaaS provides instant computing infrastructure, such as virtual machines, storage, and operating systems, over the internet. It allows you to have the most control over the hardware that runs your applications.
- **Characteristics**:
  - You rent computing resources instead of purchasing them.
  - The responsibility for maintaining and managing the service is shared between the cloud provider and the customer.
    - The cloud provider is responsible for ensuring the cloud infrastructure is operational and secure.
    - The customer is responsible for configuring and maintaining their services, ensuring they are up-to-date and available.
  - 📝 Example: Virtual machines (VMs), storage solutions, and operating systems are typical IaaS offerings.

#### Common Use Cases for IaaS

- **Migrating Workloads**: Ideal for transitioning existing on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. This approach mirrors the traditional setup, making it easier to move.
- **Test and Development**: Enables rapid setup and teardown of testing and development environments, offering cost-effective scaling.
- **Storage, Backup, and Recovery**: Provides flexible storage solutions, avoiding large upfront investments and simplifying the management of backups and data recovery. Useful for handling fluctuating and expanding storage needs.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

- **Definition**: PaaS offers an environment to build, test, and deploy applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. It includes features like authentication and other built-in capabilities.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Facilitates quick application development without the need to handle operating systems, web servers, or system updates.
  - 📝 Example: When using PaaS for web applications or databases, you don’t need to manage the server or software updates yourself.
  - Resources are billed based on usage, accessed securely over the internet.

#### Common Use Cases for PaaS

##### Development Framework

- **Definition**: Provides a platform with pre-built components that developers can use to create applications.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Includes features such as scalability, high availability, and multi-tenancy.
  - Reduces the amount of code developers need to write, speeding up development.

##### Analytics and Business Intelligence

- **Definition**: Offers tools for analyzing and interpreting data.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Helps organizations derive insights, recognize patterns, and make informed decisions regarding forecasting, product design, and investment strategies.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

- **Definition**: SaaS delivers software that is centrally hosted and managed by the service provider. Users access and use the software via the internet.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Typically involves a single version of the software shared among all customers.
  - Generally requires a monthly or annual subscription fee.
  - 📝 Example: Applications like Office 365, Skype, and Dynamics CRM Online are provided as SaaS.

## Cost and Ownership

| | IaaS | PaaS | SaaS |
| -- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Upfront Costs** | None, pay for what you use | None, pay for what you use | None, subscription-based |
| **User Ownership** | Responsible for software, operating systems, and application management | Responsible for application development | Not responsible for software maintenance or management |
| **Cloud Provider Ownership** | Manages underlying infrastructure (virtual machines, storage, networking) | Manages operating systems, network, and service configurations | Manages and maintains application software |

## Management Responsibilities

- Cloud computing services build on top of each other, with each layer providing a different level of abstraction.
  - **Abstraction Order**: SaaS > PaaS > IaaS
  - **Abstraction**: Refers to hiding the details of the underlying hardware or software, which speeds up production but reduces control over specifics.
- **IaaS**: Users manage the operating systems, data, and applications they use.
- **PaaS**: Users focus on managing their applications and data.
- **SaaS**: Users primarily interact with the software without needing to manage it.
