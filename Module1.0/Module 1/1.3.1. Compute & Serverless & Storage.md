# Compute, Serverless, and Storage

- **Cloud Computing is Like Electricity**
  - **Pay Only for What You Use**: Just like electricity, you only pay for the amount of cloud resources you consume.
  - **No Worries About Upgrades**: You don’t need to think about how the cloud provider updates their technology. It's similar to not needing to worry about power plant upgrades.
  - **Automatic Scaling**: Cloud services automatically scale to meet your needs, much like how the electricity grid handles increased demand when more people move into a town.

- **What is Cloud Computing?**
  - **Managing Hardware and Software**: Cloud computing takes care of the hardware and software management for you.
  - **Renting Resources**: You rent resources such as storage space or processing power from a cloud provider's computers.
  - **Flexible and Cost-Efficient**: You only pay for what you use, making it both adaptable and economical.

- **Cloud Providers**
  - **Offering Cloud Services**: Cloud providers offer various cloud computing services.
  - **Examples**: Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are major cloud providers.
  - **Typical Services Include**:
    - **Compute Power**: Running virtual machines or web applications.
    - **Storage**: Storing files, databases, and other data types.
    - **Networking**: Secure connections between the cloud provider and your company's infrastructure.
    - **Analytics**: Tools for visualizing data and performance metrics.

## Compute Power

- **Choosing How to Work**
  - You select how to perform tasks based on your needs and available resources.

- **Virtual Machines (VMs)**
  - **What They Are**: VMs emulate a physical computer, similar to your desktop or laptop.
  - **Includes**: They come with an operating system and hardware, allowing you to install any software you need.
  - **Maintenance**: You have more control and responsibility for maintaining VMs.
  - **Managed by Cloud Provider**: The cloud provider runs VMs in their data centers, often sharing servers with other VMs.

- **Containers**
  - **What They Are**: Containers provide a consistent, isolated environment for running applications.
  - **Differences from VMs**: Unlike VMs, containers don’t require a guest operating system, making them more portable.
  - **Portability**: Containers can run on different systems, whether on-premises or in the cloud, with minimal changes needed.
  - **Startup Time**: Containers start up quickly since there’s no operating system to initialize.
  - **Docker**: Docker is a popular open-source platform for managing containers.

## Serverless Computing

- **Running Code Without Servers**
  - **No Server Management**: Serverless computing allows you to run your application code without needing to create or manage servers.
  - **Event-Driven Functions**: Your application code is split into functions that execute in response to events or triggers.
  - **Automation**: Ideal for automating tasks, such as sending email confirmations after online purchases.
  - **Cost Structure**: You only pay for the processing time used by each function, unlike VMs and containers which incur costs even when idle.

## Storage

- **Data Reading and Writing**
  - **Common Usage**: Most devices and applications involve reading from or writing to data storage (e.g., leaving a voicemail).

- **Cloud Storage Services**
  - **Different Services**: Cloud providers offer various storage options depending on your needs.
    - **Text Storage**: Store simple text files.
    - **Database Storage**: Manage data relationships, such as in an address book.

- **Advantages of Cloud Storage**
  - **Scalability**: Cloud-based storage can scale up or down based on your needs, providing flexibility and efficiency.
