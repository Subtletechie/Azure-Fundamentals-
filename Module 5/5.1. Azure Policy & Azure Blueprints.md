# Azure Policy & Azure Blueprints

- **Azure Policy** helps ensure that all IT resources adhere to specific standards.
- **Traditional Approach:** IT teams previously had to manually define and deploy every cloud-based asset.
  - **Drawback:** This approach decreased the team's agility and limited innovation.
  - **Modern Approach:** Use Azure Policy to enforce and validate standards, while still allowing teams to create and manage their own cloud resources.

## Azure Policy

- Azure Policy enforces rules on specified or all resources.
- üìù It helps your infrastructure stay compliant with:
  - Corporate standards, cost requirements, service-level agreements, and industry compliance frameworks (like ISO 27001, NIST 800-53).
- Example: A policy might restrict virtual machines to certain sizes within your environment.
- Azure Policy evaluates both new and existing resources for compliance:
  - It can deny the creation of new, non-compliant resources.
  - It can prevent existing resources from being updated to a non-compliant state.
    - üìù‚ùó Note: Azure Policy does not automatically remove non-compliant resources!
  - It can audit both existing and new resources to identify non-compliance.
    - ![Policy Compliance](./img/policy-compliance.png)
  - It can also modify resource properties.

### Azure Policy vs RBAC

- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** Focuses on user permissions and actions at different scopes.
  - For instance, the Contributor role allows a user to contribute to resources within a resource group.
- **Azure Policy:** Focuses on the properties of resources, both during deployment and for existing resources.
  - Azure Policy controls aspects such as the types or locations of resources.
  - Unlike RBAC, Azure Policy operates on a **default-allow-and-explicit-deny basis**.

### Creating a Policy

1. **Create a [Policy Definition](#policy-definition)**
2. **Assign the Definition to a [Scope](#policy-scope)**
3. **Review Policy Evaluation Results**

### Policy Definition

- Defines what to evaluate and the actions to take.
- Includes:
  - Conditions under which the policy is enforced.
  - Effects that occur if those conditions are met.
- Example: Restricting the locations where your organization can deploy resources.
- Represented as a JSON file. Many [samples on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy) show how to structure these policies.
  - Example policy to restrict virtual machine sizes:

    ```jsonc
      {
        "if": {
          "allOf": [
            {
              "field": "type",
              "equals": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines"
            },
            {
              "not": {
                "field": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/sku.name",
                "in": "[parameters('listOfAllowedSKUs')]" // Placeholder for allowed sizes.
              }
            }
          ]
        },
        "then": {
          "effect": "Deny"
        }
      }
    ```

#### Policy Effects

- Azure Policy evaluates resource creation or updates through Azure Resource Manager first.
- Each policy definition has a single effect:
  - **Deny:** Resource creation or update fails due to policy restrictions.
  - **Disabled:** The policy rule is ignored, often used for testing.
  - **Append:** Adds extra parameters or fields to the resource during creation or update.
    - Example: Adding tags to resources.
  - **Audit** and **AuditIfNotExists:** Generates a warning in the activity log for non-compliant resources but doesn‚Äôt block the request.
  - **DeployIfNotExists:** Triggers a deployment template when certain conditions are met.
    - Example: Deploy additional configuration for SQL databases.

### Policy Scope

- Defines the range of resources or resource groups that the policy applies to.
- Can be set at various levels, from management groups to individual resource groups.

### Policy Assignment

- A [Policy Definition](#policy-definition) assigned to a specific [Scope](#policy-scope) to enforce compliance.
- Policy assignments are inherited by all child resources.
- You can exclude specific subscope resources from the policy assignment.
  - Example: Apply a policy across an entire subscription but exclude certain resource groups.
- ‚ùóNote: Policy assignments may take up to 30 minutes to become effective.

### Policy Initiatives

- Group one or more policies into a single initiative.
  - üí° Recommended to start with a single policy if you plan to expand the number of policies over time.
- Helps track compliance for broader goals and simplifies policy management.
  - Example Initiative: ***Enable Monitoring in Azure Security Center*** includes:
    - ***Monitor unencrypted SQL Database in Security Center*** for SQL databases.
    - ***Monitor OS vulnerabilities in Security Center*** for servers not meeting baseline standards.
    - ***Monitor missing Endpoint Protection in Security Center*** for servers lacking endpoint protection.

## Azure Blueprints

- Simplifies adherence to security or compliance requirements, such as those mandated by government or industry standards.
- Commonly used by cloud architects and central IT teams.
- Azure Blueprints provide a structured approach to deploy:
  - Role assignments
  - Policy assignments
  - Azure Resource Manager templates
  - Resource groups
- üí° Useful in Azure DevOps for easier automation.
- Implementation steps:
  1. **Create an Azure Blueprint**
  2. **Assign the Blueprint**
  3. **Track Blueprint Assignments**
- **Tracking and Auditing:** Monitors the alignment between the definition (what should be deployed) and the blueprint assignment (what was actually deployed).
- ü§ó Backed by Azure Cosmos DB for global distribution and replication.

### Azure Blueprints vs Resource Manager Templates

- You can use both Azure Blueprints and Resource Manager templates.
  - Blueprints can include one or more Resource Manager template artifacts.
- Differences:

  | | Azure Blueprints | Resource Manager Templates |
  |-|------------------|----------------------------|
  | Packages | Resource groups, policies, role assignments, and template deployments | Resource groups, policies, role assignments |
  | Storage | Natively in Azure | Locally or in source control |
  | Tracking | Monitors what should be deployed vs. what was deployed | No active connection between deployed resources and templates |
  | Deployment Scope | Across multiple subscriptions | Single subscription or resource group |

### Azure Blueprints vs Azure Policy

- Azure Policy is a default-allow and explicit-deny system focused on resource properties during deployment and for existing resources. It can be included as part of a blueprint definition.
- Blueprints also support using parameters with policies and initiatives.
