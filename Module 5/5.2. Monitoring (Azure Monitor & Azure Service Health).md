# Monitoring (Azure Monitor & Azure Service Health)

- üìù For auditing purposes, all interactions with Azure are recorded in the **Azure Activity Log**. This log keeps a history of actions taken within Azure, helping you track changes and operations for security and compliance.

## Azure Monitor

- **Azure Monitor** is a solution that collects, analyzes, and responds to data from both cloud and on-premises environments. It helps you understand the performance of your applications and identify potential issues that may affect them and their related resources.
- It provides a consolidated view of different types of monitoring data.
- **Benefits include:**
  - Improving availability and performance.
  - Integration with other services, such as [Azure Service Health](#azure-service-health), which allows you to check if an issue is affecting multiple regions or services globally.
- Azure Monitor also has features for visualizing monitoring data, and it can send data to various tools like Dashboards, Views, and Power BI for further analysis.

### Data sources

- **Application monitoring data**
  - This data provides insights into how your code is performing, regardless of the platform it runs on.
- **Guest OS monitoring data**
  - Includes information about the operating system that hosts your application. This OS can be running in Azure, another cloud provider, or on-premises.
- **Azure resource monitoring data**
  - Provides details about the operation of specific Azure resources.
- **Azure subscription monitoring data**
  - Contains information about the management and operation of your Azure subscription, including the health and operation of Azure services.
- **Azure tenant monitoring data**
  - Covers data about tenant-level Azure services, such as Azure Active Directory.

### Diagnostic settings

- These settings collect data from sources like virtual machines and web applications.
- **Activity Logs** record events such as when resources are created or modified.
- **Metrics** provide information on how resources are performing and the resources they are consuming.
- Some types of data include guest-level monitoring, performance counters, event logs, crash dumps, sinks, and agents.

### Application Insights

- **Application Insights** monitors the availability, performance, and usage of web applications.
- It utilizes the data analysis capabilities of Log Analytics to run queries.
- This tool can diagnose errors without needing user reports, helping you address issues proactively.
- It integrates with various development tools, enhancing its usefulness during the development process.

### Azure Monitor for containers

- This feature monitors the performance of workloads running in Kubernetes clusters within Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
- It collects metrics related to memory and CPU usage from controllers, nodes, and containers.
- It also gathers logs from containers, providing a comprehensive view of container performance.

### Azure Monitor for VMs

- Monitors both on-premises and cloud-based virtual machines at scale.
- Analyzes the performance and health of Windows and Linux VMs, including their processes and dependencies on other resources and external systems.

### Responding

#### Azure Alerts

- **Azure Alerts** proactively notifies you of critical conditions.
  - For example, it can send text messages or emails to administrators responsible for investigating issues.
- Alert rules based on metrics provide near real-time notifications based on numerical values.
- Alert rules based on logs allow for more complex logic and can analyze data from multiple sources.

#### Autoscale

- **Autoscale** adjusts the number of resources based on the load on your application.
- You can create rules using metrics from Azure Monitor to determine when to increase or decrease resources.
  - This helps manage Azure costs by scaling down unused resources.
  - You define the logic that determines when Autoscale should make these adjustments.

## Azure Service Health

- üìù **Azure Service Health** provides a comprehensive view of Azure's health status.
- It alerts you to issues affecting Azure services that are important to you and provides relevant information.
  - üìù You can set up automatic alerts to stay informed.
- It helps you prepare for planned maintenance and other changes that could impact the availability of your resources.
- The service consists of:
  - **Azure Status**: Offers a global view of the health of all Azure services.
  - **Service Health**: A customizable dashboard that tracks the Azure services you are using in specific regions.
    - Displays events like ongoing service issues, upcoming maintenance, and health advisories.
  - **Resource Health**: Assists in diagnosing and obtaining support when Azure service issues affect your resources.
    - Provides a personalized dashboard for your resources' health.
    - Offers technical support to address problems and indicates if your resources were unavailable due to Azure issues.
      - Helps assess whether a Service Level Agreement (SLA) was breached.
