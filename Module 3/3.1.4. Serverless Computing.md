# Serverless Computing

- üìù Serverless computing services in Azure include:
  - [Azure Functions](#azure-functions)
  - [Azure Logic Apps](#azure-logic-apps)

## Serverless Concepts

### Abstraction of Servers

- Serverless computing abstracts away the underlying hosting environment. This means:
  - You don‚Äôt need to worry about configuring or maintaining the infrastructure.
  - You can simply deploy your code, and it will run with high availability.
- The system automatically handles scaling, performance, and resource allocation/deallocation:
  - You do not need to manually reserve capacity for your applications.

### Event-Driven Scale

- Serverless computing is ideal for workloads that respond to incoming events. Examples of these events include:
  - Timers: For instance, if a function needs to run every day at 10:00 AM UTC.
  - HTTP Requests: Such as handling API requests or webhooks.
  - Queues: For instance, processing orders from a queue.
- **Triggers & Bindings**:
  - A function contains both code and metadata that describes its triggers and bindings.
  - **Triggers** define how and when a function is invoked.
  - **Bindings** provide a declarative method to connect to services from within your code.
- The platform automatically schedules the function to execute and scales the number of compute instances based on the frequency of incoming events.

### Micro-Billing

- You are billed only for the time your code is actively running.
  - If no function executions occur, you are not charged.
- For example, if your code runs once a day for two minutes, you will be charged for one execution and two minutes of computing time.

## Azure Functions

- Azure Functions can execute code in nearly any modern programming language.
- They are commonly used to perform tasks in response to specific events.
- Functions can be either:
  - **Stateless** (default):
    - Each time the function responds to an event, it behaves as if it has been restarted.
  - **Stateful** (known as "Durable Functions"):
    - These functions maintain a context to keep track of previous activity.
- Azure Functions are open-source and can be deployed anywhere. For more information, visit [Azure Functions Host](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host).

## Azure Logic Apps

- Azure Logic Apps are designed to automate business processes using predefined logic blocks.
- Each logic app workflow starts with a trigger (many of which can be scheduled) and then executes a series of actions.
  - **Actions** can include data transformations and control flow operations (e.g., conditional statements, loops, and branching).
- You can design Logic Apps using a visual designer available on the Azure portal or in Visual Studio.
  - Workflows are saved as JSON files that follow a specific schema.
- Azure provides over 200 connectors and processing blocks to interact with various services.
  - You can also create custom connectors if needed.
- Often, no coding is required.
  - For example, if a ticket arrives in ZenDesk, you can use cognitive services to analyze the message and then create a corresponding item in SharePoint to track the issue.

## Functions vs. Logic Apps

Both Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps can be used to create complex orchestrations. An orchestration is a series of steps or functions executed to complete a complex task. With Azure Functions, you write code for each step, while Logic Apps use a graphical user interface (GUI) to define the actions and their relationships.

You can combine both services in your orchestrations, calling functions from Logic Apps and vice versa. Here are some key differences between the two:

| | Functions | Logic Apps |
| -- | ------ | ---------- |
| **State** | Generally stateless, but Durable Functions offer stateful capabilities | Stateful |
| **Development** | Code-first approach (imperative) | Designer-first approach (declarative) |
| **Connectivity** | Requires custom code for bindings from various types | Extensive collection of connectors, Enterprise Integration Pack for B2B scenarios, and the ability to build custom connectors |
| **Actions** | Each action is an Azure Function; requires coding for activity functions | Large collection of pre-built actions |
| **Monitoring** | Uses Azure Application Insights | Monitored via the Azure portal and Log Analytics |
| **Management** | Managed via REST API and Visual Studio | Managed through the Azure portal, REST API, PowerShell, and Visual Studio |
| **Execution Context** | Can run both locally and in the cloud | Runs only in the cloud |
