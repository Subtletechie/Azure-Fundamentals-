# Azure Services

- üìù Microsoft provides a notification at least 1 month in advance before discontinuing support for an Azure service that does not have a direct successor service. This helps ensure you have adequate time to prepare for changes or migrate to alternative solutions.

- **App Hosting**
  - You can run your entire web application on Azure‚Äôs managed platform, which supports both Linux and Windows operating systems. This means you don‚Äôt need to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure, allowing you to focus on your application itself.
  - The Azure Marketplace offers a wide variety of third-party products that you can integrate and run within Azure. This includes high-profile enterprise solutions such as SAP (a leading enterprise resource planning software) and SQL database solutions (which help manage and organize your data).

- **Integration**
  - Azure provides tools like Logic Apps and Service Bus that help connect different applications and services. These tools are essential for creating workflows that can orchestrate business processes, whether they are happening in the cloud or on-premises.
  - Logic Apps allow you to automate tasks and business processes by connecting various services and systems, enabling efficient and streamlined operations.
  - Service Bus facilitates reliable message exchange between different applications, ensuring that your systems can communicate effectively and handle various workloads.

- **Security**
  - Security is a fundamental component of Azure, integrated into every service and aspect of the platform. This includes the use of hardened structures designed to resist various security threats and extensive global security intelligence monitoring to detect and respond to potential risks.
  - **Azure Identity Management** provides comprehensive tools to control and manage user access. You have the ability to set detailed permissions and access levels, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources or data within your Azure environment.
