# Compute

- Compute services are primarily used for performing calculations, executing logical operations, and running applications. These services allow you to leverage computing power to handle complex tasks and processes efficiently.
  
- Cloud-based compute services are available on-demand, meaning you can access them whenever you need to run applications without needing to own or maintain physical hardware.

- These services provide various computing resources, including multi-core processors and powerful supercomputers, through virtual machines and containers. Virtual machines simulate physical computers within the cloud, while containers provide a lightweight and portable way to run applications.

- Serverless computing is another option that lets you run applications without needing to manage or configure the underlying infrastructure. This approach abstracts away the server management and automatically scales based on demand.

- With cloud computing, you pay only for the resources you use and for the duration you use them, which can be more cost-effective than traditional models where you might pay for fixed resources.

- Azure offers several common techniques for performing compute tasks:
  - [Virtual Machines](./3.1.1.%20Virtual%20Machines.md) <sup>IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service</sup>: Virtual machines provide full control over the operating system and applications, similar to physical servers, but managed in the cloud.
  - [Containers](./3.1.2.%20Containers.md): Containers offer a portable and consistent environment for applications, isolating them from the underlying system and allowing them to run anywhere.
  - [Azure App Service](./3.1.3.%20App%20Service.md): This service is a platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps and APIs quickly and efficiently.
  - [Serverless Computing](./3.1.4.%20Serverless%20Computing.md): This approach lets you execute code in response to events without managing servers, scaling automatically as needed.

## Choosing a Computing Strategy

- When selecting a cloud computing strategy, it's important to understand that you don't have to choose a one-size-fits-all approach. You can mix and match different services to meet your needs.

- Each computing option offers unique benefits and trade-offs. For instance, serverless computing simplifies infrastructure management by automatically handling scaling and resource allocation. However, it generally expects tasks to be completed quickly, often within seconds.

- You might opt to run your core application on a virtual machine or within a container while using serverless computing for additional tasks, such as data processing, to optimize performance and cost.

- üìù From most control to least control: Virtual machines offer the most control over the environment, followed by containers with a more streamlined management approach, and serverless computing, which abstracts the underlying infrastructure entirely.
