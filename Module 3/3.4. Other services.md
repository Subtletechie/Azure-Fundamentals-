## Big Data

- Big Data refers to extremely large datasets that are complex and difficult to process using traditional methods.
  - Examples include data from weather systems, communication networks, genomic research, and imaging platforms.
- Traditional methods of data processing and analysis can become inadequate for handling Big Data.
  - Solution: Utilizing open-source cluster technologies can address these challenges.
- Azure provides a wide array of technologies and services for managing and analyzing Big Data.
- üìù **Some examples**
  - [Azure Synapse Analytics](./3.2.1.%20Databases.md#azure-synapse-analytics)
  - **Azure HDInsight**
    - Processes large volumes of data using Hadoop clusters, offering a more comprehensive solution than Azure Data Lake Analytics.
  - **Azure Data Lake Analytics**
    - Enables transformation of Big Data stored in Azure Data Lake.
  - **Azure Databricks**
    - A service based on Apache Spark for analytics, which integrates seamlessly with other Big Data services in Azure.
  - **Data Lake Store**
    - Provides secure, massively scalable storage that adheres to the open HDFS standard.
  - **Azure Data Factory**
    - Creates and manages data pipelines for efficient data analysis.

## Artificial Intelligence

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) is fundamentally based on Machine Learning.
  - Machine Learning allows computers to use existing data to predict future outcomes, behaviors, and trends without explicit programming.
- By making forecasts or predictions, AI can enhance the intelligence of applications and devices.
  - For instance, when shopping online, Machine Learning can recommend products based on previous purchases.
