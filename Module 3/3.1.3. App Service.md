# App Service

- Azure App Service is a cloud-based service that operates over HTTP.
- It allows you to build and host a variety of web-based applications without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure yourself.
- For example, you can use it to host web apps, [mobile back-ends](#mobile-apps), and RESTful APIs in several programming languages.
- It supports a range of programming frameworks, including .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, and Python.
- You can deploy applications in both Windows and Linux environments, and the service can scale to meet your needs.

## Mobile apps

- Azure App Service enables developers to create a mobile backend as a service (MBaaS).
- Key features of MBaaS include:
  - **Autoscaling**: Automatically adjusts the resources allocated to your app based on its demand.
  - **Offline data synchronization**: Ensures data is synchronized between the mobile device and the server, even when the device is offline.
  - **Broadcasting push notifications**: Sends notifications to mobile devices to engage users.
  - **Integration with identity providers**: Connects with various identity providers, such as Azure Active Directory, Google, Twitter, Facebook, and Microsoft, for user authentication.

## Azure Marketplace

- The Azure Marketplace is an online store where you can find applications that are certified and optimized to run on Azure.
- It offers a wide range of applications, including those related to AI and web development.
- You can deploy these applications directly from the Azure portal, which uses a wizard-style user interface to simplify the deployment process.
  - This makes it easy to evaluate and select different solutions that best fit your needs.

## Pricing tiers

- There are different pricing categories for Azure App Service, each suited to various types of workloads:

  | Category  | Description  |
  | --------- | ------------ |
  | **Dev / Test** | Best for less demanding workloads. This tier offers shared infrastructure and additional features like custom domains, SSL certificates, and manual scaling options. |
  | **Production** | Suitable for more demanding workloads. It includes features such as staging slots, daily backups, and a traffic manager to handle traffic distribution. |
  | **Isolated** | Designed for workloads that need advanced networking capabilities and detailed scaling options. |

- Each category has multiple pricing tiers, allowing you to choose the level of service that matches your needs.
