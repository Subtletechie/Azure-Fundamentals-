# Virtual Machines

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
  - Virtual Machines, or VMs, are software-based simulations of physical computers.
  - Each VM includes essential components like a virtual processor, memory, storage, and networking resources.
  - It runs an operating system (OS) just like a physical computer, allowing you to install and operate software.
  - You can access and manage a VM through a remote desktop client.
  - VMs are ideal when you need:
    - Complete control over the operating system (OS)
    - The ability to install and run custom software
    - Customizable hosting configurations
  - Azure manages the physical hardware.
    - You handle the setup, updates, and maintenance of the software running on the VM.
  - An **image** is a pre-configured template used to create a VM.
    - It typically includes an OS and may also include additional software like development tools or web hosting environments.

## Examples of Use-Cases

- **Testing and Development**: VMs make it easy to create various OS and application configurations, and they can be deleted when no longer needed.
- **Minor Tasks**: For example, an application can adjust to changes in demand by shutting down VMs when they are not needed and quickly starting them when demand increases.
- **Extending Your Datacenter**: You can use VMs to run applications like SharePoint in the cloud as an extension of your physical datacenter.
- **Disaster Recovery**: If your primary datacenter fails, you can create VMs in Azure to run critical applications until the primary datacenter is back online.
- **Lift and Shift**: Moving from a physical datacenter to the cloud involves taking an image of your server and running it within a VM with minimal changes.

## Scaling and High Availability

- üìù [99.99% uptime guarantee](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/sla/virtual-machines/v1_8/) is provided for all VMs that have two or more instances deployed across two or more Availability Zones.

### Domains & Maintenance Events

#### Update Domains

- Update domains are groups of VMs and their underlying physical hardware that can be rebooted simultaneously.

##### Planned Maintenance Events

- These are scheduled updates performed by Microsoft to the Azure infrastructure hosting your VMs.
- Updates are made to fix security vulnerabilities, enhance performance, and add or update features.
- These updates usually have minimal impact but sometimes require a reboot.
- VMs in an availability set are updated in a staggered manner to avoid all associated VMs being rebooted at the same time.
  - VMs are organized into different **update domains**.

#### Fault Domains

- Fault domains represent server racks and provide physical separation for workloads across various power, cooling, and network hardware supporting the physical servers in the data center.
- If a hardware issue affects a server rack, only that rack is impacted.

##### Unplanned Maintenance Events

- These involve unexpected hardware failures, such as power outages or disk failures.
- VMs in an availability set automatically switch to functioning physical servers to continue operating.
- VMs sharing the same hardware are in the same **fault domain**.

### Availability Sets

- Availability sets are a logical grouping of two or more VMs designed to maintain application availability during both planned and unplanned maintenance.
- Benefits of using an availability set include:
  - ‚ùó Up to three **fault domains**:
    - Each fault domain is a server rack with its own power and network resources.
  - Five logical **update domains**:
    - ‚ùó This number can be increased to a maximum of 20.
- Availability sets are free of charge.
  - You only pay for the VMs within the availability set.
- üí°üìù They are recommended for ensuring high availability.

### Virtual Machine Scale Sets

- Virtual machine scale sets allow you to create and manage a group of identical, load-balanced VMs.
- They enable centralized management, configuration, and updating of numerous VMs, ensuring high availability for applications.
- The number of VM instances can automatically adjust based on demand or a predefined schedule.
- üí° Useful for building large-scale services in areas like compute, big data, and container workloads.
- Provides high availability through [regional or multiple Availability Zones](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-use-availability-zones) deployment options.

### Azure Batch

- Azure Batch provides large-scale job scheduling and compute management.
- When running a job, Azure Batch:
  1. Starts a pool of compute VMs for you
  2. Installs applications and prepares data
  3. Executes jobs with the specified number of tasks
  4. Detects and handles failures
  5. Requeues any failed work
  6. Scales down the pool as tasks are completed
- üí° Ideal for scenarios requiring extensive computing power or supercomputer-level performance.
