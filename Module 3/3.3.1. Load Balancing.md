# Load Balancing

- Increases availability & resiliency
  - **Availability**: Refers to how continuously your service remains operational without any interruptions.
    - High availability (HA), or highly available, means that a service is up and running for extended periods without downtime.
    - Five nines availability: Indicates that the service is guaranteed to be operational 99.999% of the time.
  - **Resiliency**: Refers to a system's ability to continue functioning effectively under adverse conditions, such as:
    - Natural disasters
    - Scheduled system maintenance
    - Spikes in traffic
    - Threats from malicious actors
- A load balancer evenly distributes incoming traffic across multiple systems in a pool.
  - The goal is to ensure that additional systems are available in case one system fails or becomes overloaded with users.
- The load balancer acts as the main entry point for users.
  - Users do not need to know which specific system the load balancer selects to handle their requests.
- ![3 load balancer](./img/3-load-balancer.png)
  - If a virtual machine (VM) becomes unavailable or stops responding, the load balancer will cease sending traffic to that VM.
- In a 3-tier architecture, load balancers can also be used for the application and data tiers, depending on the specific requirements of your service.
- You can set up your own load balancer on a VM or use [Azure Load Balancer](#azure-load-balancer), [Azure Application Gateway](#azure-application-gateway), [Content Delivery Network](#azure-content-delivery-network), or [Azure Traffic Manager](#azure-traffic-manager).

## Azure Load Balancer

- Microsoft handles the maintenance for you.
  - You do not need to manage any infrastructure or software.
- Define forwarding rules based on the source IP address and port to a set of destination IP addresses and ports.
- Supports both inbound and outbound scenarios (including internal and external load balancers).
- Provides low latency and high throughput
  - üìù **Low latency**: Refers to a computer network's efficiency in processing a high volume of data messages with minimal delay.
- Scales to handle millions of flows for all Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) applications.
- Use-cases:
  - Managing incoming internet traffic
  - Handling internal traffic between Azure services
  - Port forwarding for specific applications
  - üí° Outbound connectivity for VMs within your virtual network

## Azure Application Gateway

- üí° A better choice if all your traffic is HTTP-based.
- Designed specifically for web applications.
  - It operates at the application layer (OSI layer 7) of the network stack, understanding the structure of HTTP messages.
- Utilizes Azure Load Balancer at the transport layer (TCP) behind the scenes.
- Functionalities:
  - **Cookie affinity**
    - Keeps user sessions on the same backend server, which is useful for maintaining session consistency.
  - **SSL termination**
    - Manages SSL certificates and passes unencrypted traffic to backend servers, reducing encryption/decryption overhead.
    - Ensures full end-to-end encryption for applications that require it.
  - **Web application firewall**
    - Provides a sophisticated firewall (WAF) with detailed monitoring and logging to detect and protect against malicious attacks.
  - **URL rule-based routes**
    - Routes traffic based on URL patterns, source IP addresses, and ports to specific destination IP addresses and ports.
    - Useful for setting up a [content delivery network](#azure-content-delivery-network).
  - **Rewrite HTTP headers**
    - Modifies or removes information from HTTP headers in inbound and outbound requests to enable critical security features or to remove sensitive information like server names.

## Azure Content Delivery Network

- Caches content at various nodes around the world, enhancing performance for end users.
- Provides a distributed network of servers to efficiently deliver web content, reducing latency.
- Can be hosted within Azure or any other location.
- üí° Use-cases:
  - Web applications with multimedia content
  - High-traffic product launch events in specific regions
  - Any event with high-bandwidth requirements in a particular area

### DNS

- DNS, or Domain Name System, translates user-friendly names into IP addresses.
  - For example, contoso.com might translate to the IP address of the load balancer at the web tier, `40.65.106.192`.
- You can use your own DNS server or utilize [Azure DNS](#azure-dns).

#### Azure DNS

- A service for hosting DNS domains using Azure infrastructure.
- Delivers extremely fast DNS responses and high domain availability.

## Azure Traffic Manager

- A DNS-based traffic load balancer.
- Improves website load times for users in different geographic locations, such as making a site in the United States load faster for users in Europe or Asia.
- Uses the DNS server closest to the user to direct traffic to a globally distributed endpoint.
- Guides the client‚Äôs web browser to a preferred endpoint.
- Can route traffic based on various methods, such as directing it to the endpoint with the lowest latency.
- Can be connected to your on-premises networks.

### Network Latency

- üìù The duration it takes for data to travel across the network.
- Typically measured in milliseconds.
- Bandwidth vs Latency
  - Bandwidth: The amount of data that can be transmitted over a connection.
  - Latency: The time it takes for that data to reach its destination.
- Influenced by factors such as:
  - The type of connection used
  - The design of your application
  - The distance between data points
- Reducing latency can be achieved by providing exact copies of your service in multiple regions using Azure Traffic Manager.

## Load Balancer vs Azure Traffic Manager

- Azure Load Balancer distributes traffic within the same region.
  - Traffic Manager operates at the DNS level, directing clients to preferred endpoints across different regions.
- Both tools contribute to system resiliency in different ways.
  - Load Balancer identifies unresponsive VMs and redirects traffic to other VMs within the pool.
  - Traffic Manager monitors the health of endpoints and reroutes traffic to the next available and responsive endpoint.
