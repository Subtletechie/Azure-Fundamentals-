# Storage

- Storage solutions are designed to be secure, durable, scalable, and easily accessible from anywhere in the world.
- For instance, they support persistent data across various devices used in mobile applications.
- They utilize REST API endpoints, which makes data available to a wide range of application types and platforms, such as .NET, JAVA, and NODE.

## Benefits

- **Automated Backup and Recovery**: This feature reduces the risk of data loss due to unexpected failures or interruptions. Automated backups ensure that your data is regularly saved and can be restored if needed.
- **Replication Across the Globe**
  - Your data is copied to multiple locations to safeguard it against both planned and unplanned events, such as maintenance or hardware failures.
  - This global replication helps ensure that your data is available even if one location experiences issues.
- **Support for Data Analytics**: You can perform analytics on your data to understand usage patterns and trends, which can help in decision-making.
- **Encryption Capabilities**: You have control over who can access your data. Encryption ensures that only authorized individuals can view or manipulate your information.
- **Multiple Data Types**: Storage solutions can handle various types of data, such as videos, text, and binary files. They also support different types of databases, including SQL and NoSQL.
- **Data Storage in Virtual Disks**: You can store up to 32 TB of data in virtual disks. This is particularly useful for large files like videos and simulations.
- **Storage Tiers**: Storage tiers help prioritize data access based on how frequently data is used. For example, frequently accessed data can be stored in a faster-access tier, while rarely used data can be moved to a lower-cost tier.

## Types of Data

### Structured Data

- Also known as **relational data**.
- This type of data follows a specific schema, which defines the structure, such as tables, fields, and relationships between different pieces of data.
- Typically stored in database tables with rows and columns.
- Relies on keys to establish connections between rows in different tables.
- üí° It is easy to input, query, and analyze because all data conforms to the same format.
  - Examples include sensor data or financial records.
- Azure services that handle structured data:
  - Azure SQL Database
  - Azure Cosmos DB \(SQL API\)

### Semi-Structured Data

- Also referred to as **non-relational** or **NoSQL data**.
- This data does not fit neatly into tables with rows and columns.
- Instead, it uses tags or keys to organize data and create a hierarchy.
- Azure services for semi-structured data:
  - Azure Cosmos DB \(MongoDB API, Cassandra API\)
  - Azure Table Storage
  - Azure Queue Storage

### Unstructured Data

- Includes data that does not have a predefined structure.
- There are no limitations on the types of data it can hold.
  - Examples include PDF documents, JPG images, JSON files, and video content.
- üí° This type of data is becoming more common as businesses seek to utilize diverse data sources.
- Azure services for unstructured data:
  - Azure Blob Storage
  - Azure File Storage
  - Azure Data Lake Storage
  - Azure Disk Storage

## Azure Storage

- Azure Storage encompasses disks attached to virtual machines, file shares, and databases.
- It allows for automatic scaling based on your needs.
- Common features include:
  - **Durable**: High availability through redundancy and replication.
  - **Secure**: Automatic encryption and role-based access control to protect your data.
  - **Scalable**: Offers virtually unlimited storage capacity.
  - **Managed**: Azure handles maintenance and critical issues.
  - **Accessible**: You can access data from anywhere via HTTP or HTTPS.

### Azure Blob Storage

- Also known as **Azure blobs**.
- Ideal for storing large objects, such as video files or images.
- This type of storage is unstructured, meaning it can hold any kind of data without restrictions.
- Supports high volumes of simultaneous uploads and large amounts of data, making it suitable for streaming and data storage.
- üí° Commonly used for backup, disaster recovery, and archiving.
- üìù Can store up to 8 TB of data for virtual machines (VM disks).

#### Storage Tiers

1. **Hot Storage Tier**: Optimized for data that is accessed frequently. This tier offers the best performance for high-access scenarios.
2. **Cool Storage Tier**: Designed for data that is accessed infrequently and stored for at least 30 days. It is a lower-cost option compared to the hot tier.
3. **Archive Storage Tier**: For data that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days. This tier offers the lowest cost for long-term storage with flexible access times.

### Azure Disk Storage

- Also known as **Azure disks**.
- Provides disks for virtual machines, applications, and other services to use.
- These disks are essentially page-blobs within [Azure Blob Storage](#azure-blob-storage).
- Allows for persistent storage accessed through an attached virtual hard disk.
- Disks can be managed by Azure or configured by the user.
- üí° Use Case Examples: Lift and shift scenarios where data does not need to be accessed outside the virtual machine.
- Available in different sizes and performance levels:
  - Solid-state drives (SSDs)
  - Hard disk drives (HDDs)
- üí° For less critical workloads, use standard SSD and HDD disks.
  - Premium SSD disks are suited for mission-critical production applications.
- Durable: Has a zero-percent annualized failure rate.

### Azure Data Lake Storage

- üìù Enables analytics on your data usage and the creation of detailed reports.
- Stores both structured and unstructured data.
- Combines the scalability and cost benefits of object storage with the reliability and performance of Big Data file systems.
- Supports various data processing needs, including batch and interactive queries, real-time analytics, and machine learning.

### Azure File Storage

- Also known as **Azure files**.
- Provides fully managed file shares that you can access and manage like a traditional file server.
- Accessible via the industry-standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.
- Ensures data is encrypted both at rest and during transit.
- Can be mounted concurrently by multiple Windows, Linux, and macOS systems.
- üìù Allows simultaneous access by any number of Azure virtual machines or roles.
- üí° Ideal for sharing files globally, diagnostic data, or application data.

### Azure Queue Storage

- A storage solution for queuing and delivering messages between applications.
- üí° Facilitates the development of flexible applications and separates functions for better durability across large workloads.
  - Decoupling application components allows them to scale independently.
  - Provides asynchronous message queuing for communication between components.
- Typically involves sender components that add messages to the queue and receiver components that retrieve and process them.
- üí° Use Case Examples:
  - Creating a backlog of tasks or passing messages between Azure web servers.
  - Distributing loads among servers and managing traffic bursts.
  - Enhancing resilience against component failures during simultaneous data access by multiple users.

### Azure Table Storage

- A NoSQL data store with a schema-less design.
- Provides a flexible way to store large amounts of structured data without a fixed schema.

### Encryption Types

#### Azure Storage Service Encryption (SSE)

- Encrypts data at rest to secure it from unauthorized access.
- Data is encrypted before being stored and decrypted when retrieved.
- The process of encryption and decryption is seamless and transparent to the user.

#### Client-Side Encryption

- Data is encrypted by client libraries before being sent to Azure.
- Azure stores the data in its encrypted form and decrypts it during retrieval.

### Replication

- Set up during storage account creation.
- Ensures data durability and availability by replicating data.
- Offers regional and geographic replication options to protect against local and global disasters.
